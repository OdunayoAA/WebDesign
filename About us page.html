          <h3 class="do you know">  Do you know that a quarter of agricultural 
            products go to waste every year?
         </h3>
      <p1>
            Yes what you just read is true, in fact even more and more 
            sustainable agricultural products are being destroyed annually 
            due to government policy, hygiene or quality regulations.
       </p1>
        <h4>Quality Regulations</h4>
      <p2>
        When i mentioned quality regulations, i mean supermarkets and other 
        agencies that buy products directly from us only pick the very best 
        and leave the rest to be destroyed.
      </p2>
      <p3>
        There is little or almost nothing we can do about this 
        ourselves as farmers because the situation is beyond what we can handle. 
      </p3>

      <h4>How we plan to help</h4>
      <p4>
        Together with my colleagues in The Hague South Holland, we have decided to
        curb the waste as much as possible by selling products that get rejected 
        by supermarkets directly to individuals who are interested for cheaper price. 
      </p4>
      <p5>
        With so much quality products that can be used, for a very good price we hope 
        to be able to make people happy and also reduce waste while doing so. 
      </p5>
      <p6>
        For this reason we come together as a group to create a space where we 
        can make this products easily accessible to the general public and help people save money. 
      </p6> 

       <h4>How to reach us</h4>
       <p7>
